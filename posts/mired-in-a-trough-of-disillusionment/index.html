<p>Just 4 months left till I graduate from my college with a degree in Computer Science and I still can’t figure out what should I be doing after I graduate. It’s not that I don’t have options but it’s because there are just too many paths lying ahead and I don’t know which way is the best way to move forward.</p>
<p>And to worsen it all, my friends from school have already figured out what they want in their life and are well placed in Big 4 tech firms and consulting firms. It’s gotten so bad, that I hardly check my Facebook newsfeed to stop comparing myself with them. It’s not that I am jealous of them, it’s just I feel bad for not being focussed over the last 3 years in college. And Oh! two of my friends are already running their successful startups.</p>
<p><img src="./flowchart.png#full" alt="Map my life"></p>
<p>I did 3 internships in the last 3 years and thankfully, I do have a full-time job offer from one of them. But, the companies that I really dream of seem so unreachable to me at this point of my life. Though, given 6 months of dedicated preparation, I can very well crack those interviews. Or perhaps not. But, the question is, should I really spend my time preparing for the interviews? I don’t know.
Miles to go before I sleep!</p>
<p>With so many options lying ahead and all of them mutually exclusive, I know I will miss out on most of them if I pick just one and focus on only that path. And, that is something that has really affected my productivity to the extent that all I have been doing over the last 7 months is nothing but signing-up for multiple courses on Coursera, Udemy and Udacity, downloading tons of video lectures and ebooks and spending hours everyday just browsing the web and jumping from one blog to another. It has gotten so worse that sometimes I just feel overwhelmed with the sheer number of tabs opened on my browser at any point of time.</p>

<p>Focus? What’s that?</p>
<p>So after being in the delirium for too long, I decided to change bases and move to a hackerspace called Jaaga on the outskirts of Bengaluru, India! It’s been almost a month now, I hope to write a post soon about my experiences at Jaaga!
